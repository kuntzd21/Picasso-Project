# Picasso

## Names

Jay Choi, Daniel Kuntz, Sam Noden, Nick Steinert

## Project Description

An application that allows the user to create expressions that
evaluate to colors and then eventually to images.

The given code base is a good start, but it is sparsely documented
(document each method/part after you understand what it's doing) and,
as your application grows, you may need to refactor.

See the specification for Picasso on the course web site.
