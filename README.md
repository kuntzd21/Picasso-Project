# Picasso

## Names

Jay Choi, Daniel Kuntz, Sam Noden, Nick Steinert

## Project Description

An application that allows the user to create expressions that
evaluate to colors and then eventually to images.

The given code base is a good start, but it is sparsely documented
(document each method/part after you understand what it's doing) and,
as your application grows, you may need to refactor.

See the specification for Picasso on the course web site.

## Extension 1: Fractals

Our first extension to the Picasso application is fractals. This extension allows the user to display two different types of fractals as images in the GUI window, the Mandelbrot fractal and the Julia fractal.

The user can display these fractals by entering mandelbrot() or julia() in the textbar on the GUI window.

## Extension 2: Saving expression history

Our second extension to the Picasso application is saving expression history. This extension allows the user to save their entered expressions. Each time an expression is saved, a pop-up window appears, displaying the current expression history.

The user can save an expression to the expression history and display this history by entering an expression in the textbar on the GUI window and then pressing the "Save to history" button.

## Extension 3: Zooming in/out

Our third extension to the Picasso application is zooming in and out. This extension allows the user to zoom in or out on an image that they have produced using the application.

The user can zoom in or out by using the "Zoom In" or "Zoom Out" buttons at the top of the GUI window.
